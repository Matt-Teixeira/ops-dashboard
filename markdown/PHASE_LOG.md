# Phase 12 — Grid Recent-Run Health

Date:
2026-06-29

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_12_grid_recent_health.txt`

Git Commit:
Pending

Review Artifacts:

- Review handoff: `notes/review_handoff_phase_12.md`

## Goals

- Stop the grid misrepresenting high-frequency single-bucket apps: show a per-APP
  recent-run health summary (runs/errored/warned over ~24h) on the app group header,
  so data_acquisition's one-latest-run status isn't mistaken for the app's health.

## Built

- `db/queries.js`: `APP_HEALTH_SQL` + `appHealth(sinceIso)` — per-app counts (runs,
  errored, warned) from `warn_error_logs` only, `WHERE inserted_at > $1` (partition
  prune), `GROUP BY app_name`. No `verbose_log`.
- `server.js`: computes it in `refreshOnce()` on the grid timer (window
  `APP_HEALTH_WINDOW_HOURS`, default 24) in its own try/catch (failure keeps last-good,
  never blanks the grid); adds `appHealth` + `appHealthWindowHours` to
  `/api/jobs/latest` additively.
- `public/grid-view.js`: pure `healthLabel(h, windowHours)`; `test/grid-view.test.js`
  +3 (83 total).
- `public/index.html`: app group header renders the label as an ERROR/SUCCESS badge,
  degrading to nothing when an app has no entry.
- Config: `APP_HEALTH_WINDOW_HOURS` in `.env.example` + `markdown/ENVIRONMENT.md`.

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- `EXPLAIN`: HashAggregate over a single-partition Index Scan
  (`app_run_logs_2026_06_inserted_at_idx`, `inserted_at >` cond); no `verbose_log`.
- Live 24h health: data_acquisition runs=1104 errored=959 warned=674 (~87% error);
  hhm_rpp_philips 528/816 errored; hhm_rpp_ge 144 runs, 0 err / 144 warn;
  ops-dashboard clean. Matches the grid's warn_error_logs status rule.

## Important Decisions

### Per-APP aggregate (not per-(app, job))

Decision: aggregate health by `app_name` only and show it on the app group header.

Reason: a per-(app, job) aggregate needs the job, which comes from
`verbose_log->argv` — reading `verbose_log` detoasts it (data_acquisition's is large).
Per-app from `warn_error_logs` is detoast-free and cheap; the group header is the
natural app-level home.

Tradeoff: multi-job apps (hhm_rpp_*) show one app-level number across their jobs
rather than per job. Accepted; per-(app, job) is recorded as deferred.

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: read-only; no new grant (SELECT on
  util.app_run_logs already held); no writes.
- Query / partition-pruning impact: `inserted_at > $1` prunes; never reads
  `verbose_log`; computed on the refresh timer, off the request path.
- Performance (request-path latency) impact: grid still served from cache; the
  aggregate is a cheap background query; a failure keeps last-good and doesn't blank
  the grid.
- Security impact: additive read-only field; no new input.
- Deployment impact: needs a `docker compose restart` to load the server change
  (done); one new optional env var with a safe default.
- API / response-shape compatibility impact: additive (`appHealth`,
  `appHealthWindowHours`).

## Validation

Commands run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --test   # 83/83
EXPLAIN APP_HEALTH_SQL                                     # single-partition index scan, no verbose_log
curl /api/jobs/latest                                     # appHealth present, grid intact
```

Results:

- Passed: 83/83 (80 prior + 3 new `healthLabel`).
- Failed: none.
- Not run: none.

Manual / smoke tests:

- `/api/jobs/latest` → `appHealth` populated (data_acquisition 959/1104 errored),
  `appHealthWindowHours: 24`, 24 jobs still served from cache.
- EXPLAIN confirmed partition prune + no verbose_log.
- Regression: `/healthz`, `/api/errors`, `/api/connectivity`, `/api/apps/:app/runs`
  all 200.

# Phase 11 — Per-App Run History

Date:
2026-06-29

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_11_app_run_history.txt`

Git Commit:
Pending

Review Artifacts:

- Review handoff: `notes/review_handoff_phase_11.md`

## Goals

- Make high-frequency, single-bucket apps inspectable: an on-demand, paginated
  per-app run-log (every run_id in a window, default 24h) so `data_acquisition` —
  which the grid collapses to one arbitrary `(default)` run — can be seen in full.

## Built

- `db/queries.js`: `APP_RUNS_SQL` + `appRuns()`. Lean — status/issue_count from
  `warn_error_logs` only (no `verbose_log` detoast); `inserted_at` emitted as a
  full-microsecond ISO string (`to_char(... 'US' ...)`). Filters `app_name=$1` and
  `inserted_at>$2` (partition prune); keyset `(inserted_at, run_id) < ($3,$4)`;
  `ORDER BY inserted_at DESC, run_id DESC LIMIT $5`.
- `lib/app-runs.js` (server-only, pure): `clampInt` (blank/absent -> default; note
  `Number("")===0`) and `shapePage` (row mapping + next keyset cursor).
- `server.js`: `GET /api/apps/:app/runs?windowHours&limit&before&beforeId` ->
  `{app, windowHours, count, runs[], nextBefore, nextBeforeId}`. Window clamped
  1..720h, limit 1..500; cursor validated; errors via the shared sanitized handler.
- `public/index.html`: routed `#appruns=<app>` view reached from the Phase 8 app
  group-head ("run log ›"); "load more" via the keyset cursor; each run links to the
  drill-down with the `inserted_at` hint; text via `textContent`; `runReq` guard.
- `test/app-runs.test.js`: +8 (clamp, shapePage, DB-free `APP_RUNS_SQL` shape guard).
  80 total. Config: `APP_RUNS_LOOKBACK_HOURS` (24), `APP_RUNS_LIMIT` (200) in
  `.env.example` + `markdown/ENVIRONMENT.md`.

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- `EXPLAIN` (as ops_dashboard_ro): single-partition **Index Scan** on
  `app_run_logs_2026_06_inserted_at_idx` with `Index Cond: inserted_at > …` and an
  `app_name` filter — partition pruned, no full scan, no `verbose_log` touched.
- Per-app 24h volume (sizes the default cap): data_acquisition 1104, hhm_rpp_philips
  816, ops-dashboard 288, hhm_rpp_ge 144.
- `warn_error_logs` ERROR>WARN>SUCCESS status matches `JOBS_LATEST_SQL`.

## Important Decisions

### Full-microsecond cursor, keyset (not OFFSET)

Decision: `inserted_at` is emitted as a 6-digit-fractional ISO string and the cursor
is `(inserted_at, run_id)`; "load more" passes the last row's pair back as
`before`/`beforeId`.

Reason: data_acquisition fires sub-second, so multiple runs share a millisecond. A JS
`Date` cursor truncates to ms and would silently DROP rows between the truncated and
true value; OFFSET would shift as new runs arrive at the top. Keyset on the exact
(µs, run_id) is gap/dup-free and stable. Verified live across a page boundary.

### Direct query, not cached

Decision: served by a direct partition-pruned query, not the in-process cache.

Reason: the cache holds one row per (app, job) by design; run history is unbounded.
The query is cheap (single-partition index scan, warn_error_logs only), so a bounded
(window + limit) request-path query is the right tool.

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: new read-only query; **no new grant** (role
  already has SELECT on util.app_run_logs); no writes/DDL.
- Query / partition-pruning impact: `inserted_at > $2` prunes to the month
  partition(s) (EXPLAIN-confirmed); never reads `verbose_log`.
- Performance (request-path latency) impact: single-partition index scan, sub-second;
  off the grid-cache path; bounded by window + limit.
- Security impact: `:app` parameterized ($1); window/limit clamped; cursor validated
  (bad uuid -> 400); shared sanitized 500; view renders via `textContent`.
- Deployment impact: needs a `docker compose restart` to load the new route (done);
  two new optional env vars with safe defaults; no grant/schema change.
- API / response-shape compatibility impact: additive (`/api/apps/:app/runs` is new).

## Validation

Commands run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --test           # 80/80
# live (running container, after docker compose restart):
EXPLAIN APP_RUNS_SQL                                              # single-partition index scan
curl /api/apps/data_acquisition/runs?limit=5                     # page 1
curl /api/apps/data_acquisition/runs?...&before=…&beforeId=…     # page 2 (keyset)
```

Results:

- Passed: 80/80 unit tests (72 prior + 8 new).
- Failed: none.
- Not run: none.

Manual / smoke tests:

- Page 1 newest-first with full-µs cursor; page 2 via cursor continued strictly older
  (14:48:06.9 < 14:48:10.4) with no dupes/gaps across sub-second runs.
- EXPLAIN: pruned to `app_run_logs_2026_06`, index scan on inserted_at, no verbose_log.
- A run-log row drilled down (data_acquisition/(default), 261 events) via the hint.
- Bad `beforeId` -> 400; grid / errors / connectivity / `/healthz` all still 200.

## Review Notes

Source:

- External (Codex) on `notes/review_handoff_phase_11.md` (source-level + unit suite;
  live EXPLAIN not re-run by the reviewer). `node --test` 80/80.

Critical issues:

- None. Codex confirmed: APP_RUNS_SQL is parameterized, partition-pruned on
  `inserted_at > $2`, avoids `verbose_log`, returns a full-microsecond cursor, and
  keysets on `(inserted_at, run_id) < (...)` with matching DESC order; the endpoint
  clamps window/limit, validates cursor halves and ignores partial cursors; the UI
  preserves the cursor string, renders via text nodes, and drills down with the
  `inserted_at` hint.

Accepted fixes:

- None (one self-caught during dev: `clampInt("")` must be the default since
  `Number("")===0`; handled + tested).

Deferred findings:

- None.

## Problems Encountered

- Problem: a JS `Date` cursor truncates `inserted_at` to ms and would drop sub-second
  runs at the page boundary.
  Resolution: emit `inserted_at` as a full-microsecond ISO string from SQL and keyset
  on `(inserted_at, run_id)`; verified gap/dup-free across a boundary.

## Follow-Up Tasks

- Optional (deferred, called out in the prompt): per-run duration/job (would detoast
  verbose_log); a server-side "errors only" filter (high value for data_acquisition,
  ~87% of runs error); per-(app, job) history.

## Commit Readiness

- Requirements implemented: yes (lean query, keyset pagination, endpoint, view, tests).
- Read-only / least-privilege rules hold: yes (no new grant; read-only).
- Time-windowed queries partition-pruned: yes (EXPLAIN-confirmed).
- Schema assumptions confirmed live: yes (plan, volume, status parity).
- Review findings addressed or deferred: handoff written; external review pending.
- Validation recorded: yes (80/80 + EXPLAIN + live pagination/drill-down/regression).
- Ready to commit: yes.

# Phase 10 — Connectivity Panel

Date:
2026-06-29

Status:
Completed (grant applied; live smoke passed 2026-06-29)

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_10_connectivity_panel.txt`

Git Commit:
469184b (impl) · cdbe51f (review fix)

Review Artifacts:

- Review handoff: `notes/review_handoff_phase_10.md`

## Goals

- Surface each equipment system's latest connectivity state (offline-first) across
  the HHM (SSH) and MMB (rsync) sources — the per-system detail the
  `data_acquisition/(default)` grid bucket hides — read-only, in a dedicated view.

## Built

- `db/setup-readonly-role.sql`: grants `USAGE ON SCHEMA alert` + `SELECT` on exactly
  `alert.offline_hhm_conn` and `alert.offline_mmb_conn` to `ops_dashboard_ro` (the
  first read outside `util`). Idempotent; header revised; sanity-check comments added.
- `db/queries.js`: `CONNECTIVITY_SQL` (`UNION ALL` of the two tables, labeled by
  `source`) + `connectivity()`. No `inserted_at` filter and no cache (justified below).
- `lib/connectivity.js` (server-only, pure; mirrors `lib/runs.js`): `connStatus`
  (false→OFFLINE / true→ONLINE / null→UNKNOWN), `captureAgeMs`/`checkedAgeMs`,
  `sortConnectivity` (worst-first → oldest-capture → system_id), `decorate`.
- `test/connectivity.test.js`: +11 tests (72 total).
- `server.js`: `GET /api/connectivity` → `{asOf, count, systems}`; thin handler,
  errors via the shared sanitizing handler.
- `public/index.html`: routed `#connectivity` view + header nav link; OFFLINE rows on
  top with the `.row-ERROR` tint; columns Source / System / Status / Error / Phase /
  Detail / Data age / Last checked / Host int. Reuses `fmtAge`/`fmtTime`/`cell`, the
  badge CSS, and the `runReq` stale-fetch guard.
- Docs: `ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` (grants, product identity, second contract),
  `docs/connectivity-schema.md` (new), `docs/apps-suite.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- As `ops_dashboard_ro` today, `SELECT` on both `alert.*` tables raises
  `permission denied for schema alert` — confirming the grant is required.
- Table shape (live inspection, DB `staging`, 2026-06): PK `system_id varchar(8)`,
  columns `capture_datetime`/`inserted_at` (timestamptz), `successful_acquisition`
  (bool), `host_intervention` (bool), `connection_error` (text), `error_category`
  (varchar), `phase` (varchar); HHM also has `rpp_host_datetime`/`daily_total_history`.
  Upsert => one row per `system_id`; PK index only; not partitioned; no json columns.

## Important Decisions

### Request-path query, no cache, no inserted_at filter

Decision: `CONNECTIVITY_SQL` runs directly on each request with no cache and no time
filter.

Reason: the alert tables are tiny (hundreds of rows), PK-indexed, json-free, and
**not partitioned** — a full scan is sub-millisecond. The Performance Rule's caching
and partition-pruning mandates target the large, partitioned, json `app_run_logs`;
neither cost exists here.

Tradeoff: a sequential scan per request, accepted as negligible at this size.

### Server-only lib module (no browser script)

Decision: `lib/connectivity.js` is a normal server-side module (like `lib/runs.js`),
not a browser-served file like `public/grid-view.js`.

Reason: the connectivity view has no client-side controls this phase, so the API
returns the final sorted/decorated shape and the browser just renders it — no need to
ship the sort/derive logic to the client.

Tradeoff: ages are computed at fetch time (the view is not auto-refreshing), which is
fine for an on-demand panel.

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: **expands** the RO role to schema `alert`
  (SELECT on exactly two tables) — the first read outside `util` — enforced in
  `db/setup-readonly-role.sql`. Still no writes/DDL anywhere.
- Query / partition-pruning impact: new query is on unpartitioned tables, so
  partition pruning is n/a; documented. `util` queries unchanged.
- Performance (request-path latency) impact: sub-ms full scan of ~540 rows; no
  detoast; grid/errors paths untouched.
- Security impact: missing grant surfaces as a sanitized 500; all `alert.*`-derived
  text rendered via `textContent` (no innerHTML); the query takes no client input.
- Deployment impact: **two-step** — run `db/setup-readonly-role.sql` (superuser) to
  apply the grant, then restart; before the grant, `/api/connectivity` 500s.
- API / response-shape compatibility impact: additive (`/api/connectivity` is new).

## Validation

Commands run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --test          # 72/72
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --check server.js lib/connectivity.js db/queries.js
docker exec ops-dashboard-app-1 node -e 'require("./db/queries"); require("./lib/connectivity")'  # load OK in real env
```

Results:

- Passed: 72/72 unit tests (61 prior + 11 connectivity); all changed server files
  parse; modules load in the running container.
- Failed: none.
- Not run: none.

Live deploy + smoke (2026-06-29, after the operator applied the grant as the
`postgres` superuser and `docker compose restart`):

- Grant landed: `ops_dashboard_ro` now reads `alert.offline_hhm_conn` (284 rows) and
  `alert.offline_mmb_conn` (255 rows) — previously `permission denied for schema alert`.
- `GET /api/connectivity` → 200 in ~70ms; `count: 539` (284 + 255), `systems` sorted
  worst-first (verified: all OFFLINE before UNKNOWN before ONLINE) and most-stale
  first within OFFLINE (top capture from 2024-04). Status tally: 142 OFFLINE / 123
  UNKNOWN / 274 ONLINE.
- No regression: `/healthz`, `/api/jobs/latest`, `/api/errors` all still 200.

Manual / smoke tests:

- Confirmed `ops_dashboard_ro` was denied on both `alert.*` tables BEFORE the grant.
- Inline `index.html` script passes `node --check`.

## Review Notes

Source:

- External (Codex) on `notes/review_handoff_phase_10.md`. `node --test` 72/72.

Critical issues:

- None.

Accepted fixes:

- (medium) `db/setup-readonly-role.sql` — the `alert` grant was additive, so
  re-running it could not *prove* the "only these two tables" claim if the role had
  drifted or held inherited/PUBLIC privileges. Made it fail closed: `REVOKE ALL` on
  schema `alert` and its tables from `ops_dashboard_ro` first, then grant only
  `USAGE` + the two `SELECT`s, then a `DO` block that `RAISE`s (aborting under
  `ON_ERROR_STOP`) if any other effective table privilege — or `CREATE` on the
  schema — is present. `has_*_privilege` is used so PUBLIC and role-membership
  privileges are caught, not just direct grants.

Deferred findings:

- None. (Codex otherwise confirmed: narrow query, shared sanitized 500, pure/covered
  `lib/connectivity.js`, UI renders alert-derived values via text nodes.)

## Problems Encountered

- None (the bare `node:lts` container can't load `db/pg-pool` without `.env`/SSL;
  verified the load in the running container instead).

## Follow-Up Tasks

- Done: `alert` grant applied (superuser) + restart + live `/api/connectivity` smoke
  (recorded above, 2026-06-29).
- Deferred: grid connectivity rollup badge on the `data_acquisition` row; per-run
  correlation via `stats.acquisition_history`.

## Commit Readiness

- Requirements implemented: yes (query, lib, endpoint, view, grant SQL, docs).
- Read-only / least-privilege rules hold: yes (SELECT-only grant on two tables).
- Time-windowed queries partition-pruned: n/a (alert tables unpartitioned; justified).
- Schema assumptions confirmed live: yes (shape + the RO-denied precondition).
- Review findings addressed or deferred: handoff written; external review pending.
- Validation recorded: yes (72/72 + parse/load + live smoke passed post-grant).
- Ready to commit: yes (shipped; grant applied and smoke green 2026-06-29).

# Phase 9 — Grid Filters, Summary & Refresh

Date:
2026-06-29

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_9_grid_filters.txt`

Git Commit:
Pending

Review Artifacts:

- Review handoff: `notes/review_handoff_phase_9.md`

## Goals

- On top of Phase 8's render pipeline, let an operator narrow and monitor the grid:
  free-text filter, status chips (incl. STALE), a summary-counts header, and a
  last-updated / auto-refresh indicator — all still client-side.

## Built

- `public/grid-view.js`: `filterJobs(jobs,{search,statuses})` (case-insensitive
  app/job/runId match; status-set membership where STALE matches `j.stale===true`,
  not a status; empty filter = all; accepts a Set or array; never mutates) and
  `summarize(jobs)` → `{total,ERROR,WARN,SUCCESS,stale,unknown}`.
- `test/grid-view.test.js`: +11 tests (61 total).
- `public/index.html`: debounced `#grid-search`; status chips (ERROR/WARN/SUCCESS/
  STALE) with counts + `aria-pressed`/`.active`, doubling as the summary; a summary
  line that appends `· showing K` while filtering; a live "updated Ns ago" label off
  `gridData.asOf` ticking every 5s; an auto-refresh checkbox (default on) polling
  `refresh()` every `AUTO_REFRESH_MS` (120s) only while the dashboard is visible.
  `renderGrid()` is now filter → sort → group; `gridView` gains `search` + `statuses`
  (persisted with the Phase 8 keys).

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- None new. No queries touched. Confirmed the live `/api/jobs/latest` payload still
  exposes `status`, `stale`, `count`, `coverage.unknown`, and `asOf` (24 jobs from
  the running service; summarize → 14 ERROR / 9 WARN / 1 SUCCESS / 2 stale, which
  reconciles: 14+9+1 = 24).

## Important Decisions

### Summary counts cover the whole grid, not the filtered set

Decision: the chip/summary counts derive from `gridData.jobs` (all jobs); the
filtered count is shown separately as `· showing K`.

Reason: the chips double as filter toggles, so their counts must be a stable
overview ("ERROR 14") that doesn't collapse to 0 as you filter; `ERROR+WARN+SUCCESS`
always equals the total.

Tradeoff: the summary total and the visible row count differ while a filter is
active — surfaced explicitly via `showing K` so it isn't mistaken for a miscount.

### Auto-refresh polls no faster than the cache changes

Decision: `AUTO_REFRESH_MS = 120000`, paused while a drill-down is open.

Reason: the grid is served from an in-process cache that only refreshes every server
`GRID_REFRESH_MS` (≈120s); polling faster just re-fetches identical data.

Tradeoff: a manual `refresh` button remains for an immediate pull.

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: none — frontend only, no DB code path.
- Query / partition-pruning impact: none — no query changed; drill-down `at=` hint intact.
- Performance (request-path latency) impact: none — `/api/jobs/latest` untouched;
  filtering/summarizing re-render from memory. Auto-refresh polls ≤ once / 120s and
  only when the dashboard is visible.
- Security impact: chips/labels built via `textContent`; the search term is only a
  `String.includes` needle, never injected; `localStorage` holds only view prefs,
  validated against allowlists with a try/catch fallback.
- Deployment impact: none — same static-served page + module; no env/port/command change.
- API / response-shape compatibility impact: none.

## Validation

Commands run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --test
```

Results:

- Passed: 61/61 (50 prior + 11 new filter/summarize tests).
- Failed: none.
- Not run: none.

Manual / smoke tests:

- Inline `index.html` script passes `node --check`.
- Running container serves the new controls (`#grid-search`, `#status-chips`,
  `#autorefresh`) and `grid-view.js` exposing `filterJobs`/`summarize`.
- Live 24-job payload: `summarize` → 14/9/1, stale 2, unknown 0 (reconciles to 24);
  search "ge_" → 3 rows; ERROR chip → 14; STALE chip → 2; empty filter → 24.
- Browser-interactive checks (debounced search, chip toggles, "updated Ns ago" tick,
  auto-refresh preserving view state) rest on the syntax check + unit-tested logic;
  recommend an eyeball pass.

## Review Notes

Source:

- External (Codex) on `notes/review_handoff_phase_9.md`.

Critical issues:

- None. Codex confirmed: `filterJobs` is pure; STALE matches only `j.stale === true`;
  status tokens are OR'd; search combines with status as an AND; `renderGrid()` does
  filter → sort → group so group counts/roll-ups reflect visible rows; summary chips
  build from the full grid with `showing K` separate; localStorage hydration is
  guarded/allowlisted; auto-refresh uses one 120s interval gated on dashboard
  visibility. `node --test` passed.

Accepted fixes:

- None.

Deferred findings:

- None.

## Problems Encountered

- None.

## Follow-Up Tasks

- Phase 10 (Pending): dedicated read-only Connectivity view over the `alert.*` tables.

## Commit Readiness

- Requirements implemented: yes (filter/search, status chips incl. STALE, summary
  header, last-updated + auto-refresh; filter precedes grouping).
- Read-only / least-privilege rules hold: yes (frontend only).
- Time-windowed queries partition-pruned: n/a (no query changed).
- Schema assumptions confirmed live: yes (payload fields verified).
- Review findings addressed or deferred: handoff written; external review pending.
- Validation recorded: yes (61/61 tests + smoke).
- Ready to commit: yes.

# Phase 8 — Grid Grouping & Sorting

Date:
2026-06-29

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_8_grid_grouping_sort.txt`

Git Commit:
Pending

Review Artifacts:

- Review handoff: `notes/review_handoff_phase_8.md`

## Goals

- Let an operator organize the job grid client-side: group by app / job / none with
  collapsible groups, and sort any column — headline being sort by last-run datetime.
- Do it with zero backend change, re-rendering from the payload already in memory.

## Built

- `public/grid-view.js` (new): pure, DOM-free transforms — `sortJobs(jobs,key,dir)`,
  `groupJobs(jobs,by)`, `groupRollupStatus(rows)`, shared `STATUS_RANK`
  {ERROR:0,WARN:1,SUCCESS:2,INFO:3}. Nulls sort last in both directions; status sort
  is worst-first, tie-broken by most-stale-first (`ageMs`) then an app/job fallback;
  never mutates input. Dual export
  (browser `window.GridView` + Node `require`).
- `test/grid-view.test.js` (new): +17 tests (50 total).
- `public/index.html`: `loadGrid()` split into fetch → store `gridData` →
  `renderGrid()`, so group/sort/collapse changes re-render from memory with no
  refetch. Added a group-by selector, clickable sortable headers (▲/▼ + `aria-sort`,
  keyboard-operable), collapsible group-head rows with a worst-status roll-up badge,
  and a `gridView` state object persisted to `localStorage` (`ops-grid-view`). CSS in
  the existing `<style>`. Server-side sort (`server.js:119`) left untouched.

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- None new. This phase touched no queries. Confirmed the live `/api/jobs/latest`
  payload still carries the fields the client sorts/groups on (`app, job, runId,
  lastRun, startedAt, endedAt, durationMs, status, issueCount, ageMs, stale`) — 24
  jobs returned from the running service.

## Important Decisions

### Browser module lives in public/, not lib/

Decision: the pure transforms ship as `public/grid-view.js`, not `lib/grid-view.js`
as the prompt suggested.

Reason: `server.js` serves static files only from `public/`. Placing the module there
loads it via a plain `<script src>` with no build step; mounting `lib/` statically
would expose server-only modules (run-cache, self-log, pg-*) to the browser.

Tradeoff: the file sits beside the page it serves rather than next to the other pure
libs; mitigated by keeping it dependency-free and unit-tested from `test/`.

### Full re-render on control change (no partial DOM toggle)

Decision: group/sort/collapse rebuild the grid `<tbody>` from `gridData`.

Reason: simpler and demonstrably correct; the grid is tens of rows, so a rebuild is
instant. Crucially it is still **render-from-memory** — no refetch.

Tradeoff: marginally more DOM churn than toggling `hidden`; negligible at this scale.

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: none — frontend only, no DB code path added.
- Query / partition-pruning impact: none — no query changed; drill-down links still
  carry the `at=` (inserted_at) hint so the run query still prunes.
- Performance (request-path latency) impact: none — `/api/jobs/latest` untouched
  (~3ms); control changes re-render client-side with no network call.
- Security impact: all payload-derived text rendered via `textContent`/`createTextNode`
  (no innerHTML); `localStorage` holds only view prefs; inputs validated against
  allowlists with try/catch fallback.
- Deployment impact: none — same static-served single page plus one new static asset
  (`grid-view.js`); no env, port, or command change.
- API / response-shape compatibility impact: none — no endpoint or response changed.

## Validation

Commands run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --test
```

Results:

- Passed: 50/50 (33 prior + 17 new `grid-view` tests).
- Failed: none.
- Not run: none.

Manual / smoke tests:

- `/grid-view.js` served (200) and exposes `STATUS_RANK,sortJobs,groupJobs,groupRollupStatus`.
- `/api/jobs/latest` returns 24 jobs with the expected keys (unchanged shape).
- Inline `index.html` script passes `node --check` (no syntax error).
- The real 24-job payload run through `sortJobs`/`groupJobs`/`groupRollupStatus`:
  groups by app with correct counts + roll-ups (data_acquisition→ERROR, ge→WARN),
  status-asc surfaces ERRORs first, duration-desc keeps nulls last, group=none → one
  group of 24.
- Browser-interactive checks (click-to-sort, collapse/expand, localStorage persist)
  rest on the syntax check + the unit-tested pure logic; recommend an eyeball pass.

## Review Notes

Source:

- External (Codex) on `notes/review_handoff_phase_8.md`.

Critical issues:

- None. Codex confirmed: fetch/render split intact, controls re-render from cached
  `gridData`, grouped rows preserve `runHref(j.runId, j.lastRun)`, payload text via
  text nodes (no innerHTML), localStorage guarded/allowlisted, server-side sort
  (`server.js:119`) unchanged; `node --test` 50/50.

Accepted fixes:

- (nit, docs only) Documentation drift: this entry said the status sort had an
  "app/job tiebreak"; the code/tests actually tie-break by most-stale-first (`ageMs`)
  then fall back to app/job. Corrected in this entry and the handoff. No code change.

Deferred findings:

- None.

## Problems Encountered

- Problem: static serving is `public/`-only, but the prompt put the shared module in
  `lib/`.
  Resolution: hosted it at `public/grid-view.js` (dual-export) — browser-served and
  Node-testable — rather than statically exposing all of `lib/`.

## Follow-Up Tasks

- Phase 9 (Pending): filter/search box, status chips, summary-counts header,
  last-updated/auto-refresh — builds on this render pipeline.

## Commit Readiness

- Requirements implemented: yes (grouping, collapse, sortable columns incl. last-run
  datetime, extracted pure module + tests).
- Read-only / least-privilege rules hold: yes (frontend only).
- Time-windowed queries partition-pruned: n/a (no query changed; drill-down hint kept).
- Schema assumptions confirmed live: yes (payload shape verified against the service).
- Review findings addressed or deferred: handoff written; external review pending.
- Validation recorded: yes (50/50 tests + smoke).
- Ready to commit: yes.

# Phase 7 — Self-Monitoring

Date:
2026-06-26

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_7_self_monitoring.txt`

Git Commit:
baf398d (impl); review fixes follow in a subsequent commit

## Goals

- Let ops-dashboard log its own health into util.app_run_logs under
  app_name="ops-dashboard" so it appears in its own grid and self-failures are visible.
- Do it without weakening the read-only posture: the write is DB-enforced, scoped,
  and opt-in.

## Built

- `db/setup-writer-role.sql`: the write path, enforced by the DB.
  - `ops` schema (we own it); `util` stays pipeline-owned.
  - `ops.log_ops_dashboard_run(run_id, verbose_log, warn_error_logs)` SECURITY DEFINER,
    hard-codes app_name='ops-dashboard', fixed search_path, parameterized.
  - `ops_writer_owner` (NOLOGIN) owns the function and is the ONLY role with INSERT on
    util.app_run_logs — unreachable by any client.
  - `ops_dashboard_rw` (the app's writer login) has EXECUTE on the function and nothing
    else. No trigger/RLS on the shared partitioned table.
- `utils/logger/{log.js,enums.js}`: minimal run-log builder (event shape matches the
  suite); the first event carries note.argv[2]=job so the grid buckets it.
- `lib/self-log.js`: pure `buildHeartbeat(health)` + `writeHeartbeat(writerDb, health)`.
- `db/pg-writer.js` + `db/pgp.js` + `db/ssl.js`: a separate writer connection; the
  pg-promise root and SSL builder are now shared so the writer reuses them. pg-pool.js
  read behavior is unchanged (same role, config, exported object).
- `server.js`: opt-in heartbeat (`SELF_LOG_ENABLED`, every `SELF_LOG_INTERVAL_MS`,
  default 5 min) capturing asOf / cacheSize / coverage.unknown / lastRefreshMs /
  lastError; a failed refresh becomes an ERROR event. Write failures are caught (never
  crash serve).
- `config/schedules.js`: `ops-dashboard/heartbeat` { everyMin:5, graceMin:10 }.
- Env: `SELF_LOG_ENABLED`, `SELF_LOG_INTERVAL_MS`, `PG_WRITER_USER`,
  `PG_WRITER_PASSWORD`. `test/self-log.test.js`: +6 tests (32 total).

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- Insert shape ['app_name','run_id','verbose_log','warn_error_logs'] into
  util.app_run_logs; inserted_at defaults to now(); verbose_log/warn_error_logs json.
- The SECURITY DEFINER + NOLOGIN-owner design works: as ops_dashboard_rw the function
  writes an 'ops-dashboard' row (POSITIVE); a direct INSERT is denied
  (`permission denied for schema util`); ops_dashboard_ro cannot EXECUTE the function
  (`permission denied for schema ops`).
- Partition for now() exists (app_run_logs_2026_06); there is NO 2026_07 partition yet
  and no DEFAULT partition (see Follow-Up).

## Important Decisions

### DB-enforced write scope (SECURITY DEFINER function, not code/trigger/RLS)

Decision: the only write is a SECURITY DEFINER function that hard-codes the app_name;
the writer login has EXECUTE-only; the INSERT-capable owner is NOLOGIN.
Reason: makes "writes only app_name=ops-dashboard, nothing else" provable at the role
level, not dependent on app code. Avoids triggers/RLS on the shared partitioned
util.app_run_logs, which could break the pipeline apps' inserts.
Tradeoff: a superuser/admin setup step (db/setup-writer-role.sql) + a second credential.

### Opt-in, heartbeat (not a batch job)

Decision: SELF_LOG_ENABLED gates self-logging (off by default); the unit is a periodic
heartbeat from the long-running serve process.
Reason: Phase 4 chose the in-process cache, so there is no batch job to hang logging
off. Opt-in keeps the app read-only until the writer is provisioned.

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: read path + role unchanged; the new write is a
  separate, EXECUTE-only credential, DB-scoped to one app_name.
- A dead process / DB outage writes no heartbeat -> the ops-dashboard row ages to STALE
  (correct "down" signal; can't self-log an unreachable DB).
- API compatibility: no endpoint/response changes; ops-dashboard just appears as a new
  grid row.

## Validation

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --test   # 32 pass (6 new + 26)
psql ... -f db/setup-writer-role.sql                       # provision (+ pos/neg tests)
docker compose up -d                                       # recreate (.env changed)
```

- 32/32 unit tests. Positive + both negative DB tests pass.
- Live: boot logs "self-logging on"; heartbeat writes cleanly (0 failures post-fix);
  grid shows 24 jobs incl. ops-dashboard/heartbeat = SUCCESS, not stale, coverage 24/24.

## Review Notes

Source: external (Codex) on `notes/review_handoff_phase_7.md`. Boundary checks passed
independently (rw write ok; direct INSERT/SELECT denied; ro cannot execute; owner
NOLOGIN; no elevated attributes/memberships). Accepted fixes (follow-up commit):

- (medium) db/setup-writer-role.sql was additive and didn't enforce least privilege on
  rerun/drift. Now forces role attributes (ALTER ROLE ... NOLOGIN/NOSUPERUSER/
  NOCREATEDB/NOCREATEROLE/NOREPLICATION/NOBYPASSRLS) and revokes-before-grants the
  minimal set, plus a verification block in comments. Re-ran live: idempotent; owner
  canlogin=f, rw login-only, util grant = only ops_writer_owner/INSERT.
- (low) lastError was persisted verbatim into warn_error_logs / the error feed. Added
  summarizeError() (single-line, capped 300 chars); full detail stays in container
  logs. New test.
- (nit) Recorded the Phase 7 commit SHA (baf398d) instead of "Pending".

Tests 33/33.

## Problems Encountered

- Problem: `SELECT void_function()` returns one (void) row, so pg-promise `db.none`
  rejected with "No return data was expected" — even though the INSERT had run.
  Resolution: use `db.one` and discard the row.

## Follow-Up Tasks

- Partition dependency: a now()-stamped insert needs the current month's partition.
  Only through 2026_06 exist and there is no DEFAULT partition, so on 2026-07-01 both
  the pipeline's inserts and our heartbeat fail until the July partition is created
  (a pipeline-owned concern). Our write is non-fatal; watch for the ops-dashboard row
  (and others) going STALE around month boundaries as the signal.
- Optional: also write the JSON file to /opt/run-logs/ops-dashboard (mount exists);
  deferred — the grid reads the DB row, the file is redundant for now.

## Commit Readiness

- Read-only read path + role unchanged: yes. Write is DB-scoped + opt-in: yes.
- Schema assumptions confirmed live (incl. neg tests): yes.
- Validation recorded: yes. Ready to commit: yes.

# Phase 6 — Real Schedule Cadences

Date:
2026-06-26

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_6_real_schedules.txt`

Git Commit:
234574d (impl); SHA recorded in a follow-up commit

## Goals

- Make the STALE badge trustworthy: confirm/complete `config/schedules.js` against
  the real cron, fill the jobs the grid shows but config omitted, add provenance to
  every entry, and stop asserting a cadence for a job that isn't scheduled.
- Surface coverage — which grid (app, job) pairs have no configured cadence
  (stale=null) — so silent drift is visible as new apps start logging. Unknown must
  stay null, never falsely green.

## Built

- `config/schedules.js`: rewritten from placeholders to confirmed cadences, each with
  a provenance comment (cron file line + observed median gap, app_run_logs 2026-06-26).
  - Added the 15 Philips variants the grid shows but config omitted:
    `PHILIPS_MRI_MONITOR_1..5`, `_RMMU_1..5`, `_LOG_1..5` (all every 30 min).
  - `SIEMENS_CV`: removed its false 30-min entry — it is in neither cron file and has
    no runs in 30 days (absent from the grid). Left intentionally unknown (stale=null),
    documented inline.
  - `data_acquisition/(default)`: a stall budget (not a literal schedule), set to
    `everyMin: 20, graceMin: 10` (30 min) above the MAX normal inter-run gap so it
    flags a full-pipeline stall without flapping. (Initially shipped at 10 min sized
    on p90; corrected in the budget-fix follow-up — see Review Notes.)
  - Recorded the known wall-clock schedules (`monday/EQUIPMENT_RTT 25 7 * * *`,
    `acumatica 20 7 * * *`, `part-source/INV_FEED_SYNC 0 6 * * *`) as commented future
    entries — deferred until a cron evaluator and those apps' logs exist.
- `lib/staleness.js`: added pure, exported `isConfigured(app, job)` and
  `coverage(pairs)` → `{ total, configured, unknown, unknownJobs }`. `evaluate`
  unchanged.
- `server.js`: `/api/jobs/latest` now returns an additive `coverage` object (existing
  fields untouched); the grid-refresh log line reports `cadence unknown: N/total`.
- `public/index.html`: header `meta` appends `· N cadence unknown` when > 0; a
  `stale === null` row now renders a muted `? CADENCE` badge (new `.unknown` class) so
  an unknown-cadence job is never visually mistaken for a healthy one.
- `test/staleness.test.js`: +7 tests (configured Philips variant, SIEMENS_CV stays
  null, the (default) stall budget within/over, `isConfigured`, `coverage`).

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- Re-ran `notes/schedule-cadence-probe.sql` as `ops_dashboard_ro`: every active
  ge/philips grid job (incl. all 15 Philips variants) = 30.0 min median gap;
  `data_acquisition/(default)` = 0.4 min median / 2.8 p90 / 10.1 p99 / 12.3 max
  (7-day window) — the basis for the 30-min stall budget.
- 30-day grid set = 23 (app, job) pairs (matches the cache). `hhm_rpp_siemens` has
  only `SIEMENS_CT` and `SIEMENS_MRI` (both ~407 h / ~17 d idle, dormant); there is
  **no** `SIEMENS_CV` in the grid or cron — confirming it must be unknown, not 30 min.
- After this phase all 23 grid jobs resolve to a real boolean (no stale=null); the
  15 previously-unconfigured Philips variants are now covered.

## Important Decisions

### data_acquisition/(default) stall budget = 30 min

Decision: `everyMin: 20, graceMin: 10` (30-min budget). It is the aggregate of many
staggered sub-jobs, so a meaningful signal is "the whole pipeline went silent."
Reason: the budget must clear the MAX normal inter-run gap or it flaps. The 7-day gap
distribution is median 0.4 / p90 2.8 / p99 10.1 / max 12.3 min, so 30 min (~2.4× max)
flags a real stop without false positives. (Shipped initially at 10 min sized on p90,
which sat below the max gap; corrected in the budget-fix follow-up — see Review Notes.)
Tradeoff: `everyMin` is being used as a silence budget, not a literal interval;
documented inline. Per-system_id staleness stays out of scope (one (default) bucket).

### Defer cron-string parsing; record wall-clock crons as comments

Decision: keep `everyMin` only; record `monday`/`acumatica`/`part-source` wall-clock
crons as commented future entries.
Reason: every current grid job is interval-scheduled and timezone-independent, so a
cron evaluator is unnecessary now; those apps don't log to the DB yet.
Tradeoff: activating them later needs a cron parser in `lib/staleness.js` and a
job-name (argv[2]) casing check — noted in the config comment.

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: none — config + pure logic only; coverage reads
  the in-memory cache. Verification ran as `ops_dashboard_ro`. No write path added.
- Query / partition-pruning impact: none — no new query; the probe is bounded by
  `inserted_at` and run out-of-band.
- Performance (request-path latency) impact: negligible — `coverage()` is O(23) over
  the in-memory grid per request; live grid still ~ms.
- Security impact: none — `.env` uncommitted; no secrets in code/docs; error shapes
  unchanged.
- Deployment impact: none beyond a restart to load the new config (source bind-mounted;
  no env or compose change).
- API / response-shape compatibility impact: additive `coverage` field only;
  `/api/errors` and `/api/runs/:run_id` untouched.

## Validation

Commands run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --test       # 26 pass
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --check server.js
psql ... -U ops_dashboard_ro -f notes/schedule-cadence-probe.sql   # cadences re-confirmed
docker compose restart app                                    # load new config
```

Results:

- Passed: `node --test` 26/26 (7 new); `server.js` syntax OK.
- Failed: none.
- Not run: none.

Manual / smoke tests (service live on :8080 after restart):

- Boot log: `grid bootstrap: 23 rows -> 23 jobs ...; cadence unknown: 0/23`.
- `/api/jobs/latest`: `coverage = {total:23, configured:23, unknown:0, unknownJobs:[]}`;
  stale tally 2 true / 21 false / 0 null — every grid job resolves to a real boolean.
- Dormant siemens read correctly: `SIEMENS_CT=true`, `SIEMENS_MRI=true` (~17 d idle).
- Unknown-cadence count (0) matches the jobs left unconfigured in the grid (none).
- Served `/` carries the new markup (`cadence unknown`, `? CADENCE`, `.badge unknown`,
  `r.coverage`).

## Review Notes

Source:

- Self-review against `markdown/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` (walked: scope/non-goals held;
  read-only + RO role intact; no new query; additive response shape; secrets clean;
  validation recorded).
- Pre-handoff diff review (this session) caught one issue, fixed before the external
  pass; handoff is `notes/review_handoff_phase_6.md`.

Critical issues:

- None.

Accepted fixes (follow-up commit):

- (medium) `data_acquisition/(default)` stall budget was `{everyMin:5, graceMin:5}`
  = 10 min, sized on p90 (2.8 min). Re-measuring the gap distribution showed p99
  10.1 / MAX 12.3 min over 7 days, so the aggregate bucket would intermittently flap
  a false STALE. Raised to `{everyMin:20, graceMin:10}` = 30 min (~2.4x max), comment
  corrected to justify against the max gap, tests updated. 26/26.

Deferred findings:

- None. (Wall-clock cron activation is intentionally deferred to a future phase with a
  cron evaluator, recorded as commented config entries.)

## Problems Encountered

- Problem: the running container caches `config/schedules.js` at require-time, so new
  cadences don't take effect until restart.
  Resolution: `docker compose restart app` (source is bind-mounted; no rebuild needed),
  then confirmed the boot log + grid coverage reflected the new config.

## Follow-Up Tasks

- When `monday` / `acumatica` / `part-source` (and other apps) start logging to the DB,
  activate their commented wall-clock entries — which needs a cron evaluator in
  `lib/staleness.js` and confirming each job's argv[2] casing. The coverage count will
  flag them as unknown until then.

## Commit Readiness

- Requirements implemented: yes (confirmed cadences + provenance, 15 variants added,
  SIEMENS_CV unknown, (default) stall budget, coverage surface + UI).
- Read-only / least-privilege rules hold: yes (config/logic only; RO role).
- Time-windowed queries partition-pruned: yes (no new query; probe `inserted_at`-bound).
- Schema assumptions confirmed live: yes (probe + 30-day grid set re-run as RO).
- Review findings addressed or deferred: none outstanding.
- Validation recorded: yes.
- Ready to commit: yes.

# Phase 5 — Run Drill-Down UI

Date:
2026-06-26

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_5_run_drilldown_ui.txt`

Git Commit:
11ce769

## Goals

- Give users a readable per-run event timeline over the existing
  `GET /api/runs/:run_id`, reached from the job grid and the error feed.
- Keep the phase frontend-only: no new endpoints, no query/DB/credential changes,
  no framework or build step; don't change `/api/jobs/latest` or `/api/errors`
  response shapes.

## Built

- `public/index.html` (only file changed): a hash-based router in the existing
  static page. No hash → the dashboard (grid + error feed); `#run=<id>&at=<hint>`
  → a drill-down view rendered into a new `#run-view` section.
  - Grid run-id cell repointed from the raw `/api/runs` JSON URL to the in-page
    drill-down, still passing the row's `inserted_at` as the hint.
  - Error-feed rows are now clickable (cursor/hover affordance) and link to the
    run using the event `dt` as the hint.
  - Drill-down render: run header (app/job, derived status badge, run id,
    inserted/started/ended, duration, event count) + an event timeline table
    (When, Type, Func, Tag, Detail, Message). WARN/ERROR rows tinted; added a
    neutral `.INFO` badge style.
  - All log-derived text set via `textContent` (no `innerHTML`); `note` rendered
    as text (surfaced `system_id`/`sme` + `job_id`, then full JSON).
  - Large-payload guard: render at most `RENDER_CAP` (500) events initially with a
    "show all N events" button to reveal the rest; rows built in a
    `DocumentFragment`.
  - Clean 400 ("Invalid run id.") / 404 ("Run not found — it may have aged out of
    the 30-day window.") / generic-failure copy in the run view; no stack traces.
- No changes to `server.js`, `db/queries.js`, or any API response shape.

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- Event objects across all writing apps carry `dt`, `type` (INFO/WARN/ERROR),
  `func`, `tag`, `run_id`, `note` (an object: `job_id`, `system_id`/`sme`,
  `message`, `skip_reason`, …); `err_msg` is present only on ERROR / some WARN.
  No doc corrections needed — matches `docs/logging-schema.md`.
- Worst-case run is `data_acquisition` at ~1,625 events / ~680 KB text (drives the
  RENDER_CAP). `/api/errors` events already include `run_id` and `dt`, so the
  error-feed link needs no API change.
- `EXPLAIN` on the hinted run query with both an `inserted_at` hint and a `dt`
  hint shows `Subplans Removed: 6` — only `app_run_logs_2026_06` is scanned via
  the inserted_at index. Both entry points prune to one monthly partition.

## Important Decisions

### Single-file hash router (no second HTML page)

Decision: add an in-page hash router rather than a second `run.html`.
Reason: reuses the existing `fmtTime`/`fmtDur`/`cell` helpers and styles, avoids a
second markup fetch, and keeps the no-build static approach.
Tradeoff: one slightly larger file; deep-linking to a run loads the dashboard
lazily on first back-navigation (handled via a `dashboardLoaded` guard).

### Cap the initial timeline render

Decision: render up to 500 events, with a "show all" button for the remainder.
Reason: the worst-case ~1,625-event `data_acquisition` run keeps the DOM and the
first paint responsive without dropping data.
Tradeoff: a one-click reveal for the few large runs; small runs are unaffected.

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: none — no new code path touches the DB; the
  app still reads as `ops_dashboard_ro` over the unchanged endpoints.
- Query / partition-pruning impact: none added; both drill-down entry points pass
  a hint so the existing hinted query prunes to one partition (EXPLAIN-confirmed).
- Performance (request-path latency) impact: none server-side; hinted run fetch
  ~30–60 ms incl. the 680 KB worst-case payload. Client caps initial render.
- Security impact: all log-derived content rendered via `textContent` — no
  injection from log payloads; 400/404 surfaced as plain copy, not raw errors.
- Deployment impact: none — static file served from the bind mount; no restart
  or env change. Same `:8080` service.
- API / response-shape compatibility impact: none; `/api/jobs/latest`,
  `/api/errors`, `/api/runs/:run_id` all unchanged.

## Validation

Commands run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --test   # 20 pass
docker run --rm -v "$SP":/s -w /s node:lts node --check inline.js   # inline script parses
```

Results:

- Passed: `node --test` 20/20; inline-script syntax check OK.
- Failed: none.
- Not run: none.

Manual / smoke tests (service live on :8080, static file served from bind mount):

- Grid-style request `/api/runs/<id>?inserted_at=<lastRun>` → 200 in ~54 ms.
- Error-feed-style request `/api/runs/<id>?inserted_at=<event dt>` → 200 in ~58 ms.
- Both hints: `EXPLAIN` shows `Subplans Removed: 6`, single `app_run_logs_2026_06`
  index scan (one-partition prune).
- Large run (1,625 events) → 200 in ~30 ms, 680 KB; cap + "show all" path exercised.
- Bad id (`not-a-uuid`) → 400 `{"error":"invalid run_id ..."}`; missing well-formed
  id → 404 `{"error":"run not found"}`. Both render as clean copy, no stack trace.
- Served `/` carries the new markup (`run-view`, `runHref`, `RENDER_CAP`).

## Review Notes

Source:

- Self-review against `markdown/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` (walked below), then an
  external (Codex) review against `notes/review_handoff_phase_5.md`.

Critical issues:

- None.

Accepted fixes (subsequent commit):

- (low) `showRun` had no stale-response guard — opening run A then B (or
  navigating back) could render the slower fetch into a stale/hidden view. Added a
  monotonic `runReq` token bumped on every navigation; responses that no longer
  match the active route are ignored.
- (low) 404 copy wrongly blamed the "30-day window" (that's the grid cache, not
  the DB, which the drill-down reads directly). Changed to "Run not found, or the
  timestamp hint no longer matches this run."
- (low) Error-feed rows were mouse-only `<tr>`s. Added `tabindex=0`, `role=link`,
  and Enter/Space activation so they match the grid's `<a>` entry points.

Deferred findings:

- None. No XSS found (log-derived values go through textContent); the error-feed
  `className = "badge " + e.type` is cosmetic class assignment, not HTML.

## Problems Encountered

- Problem: `node` is not on the host PATH (apps run in Docker); a probe script in
  the scratchpad isn't under the compose bind mount.
  Resolution: ran probes/EXPLAIN in a `node:lts` container on `pg_net` with the
  probe bind-mounted as a single file into `/workspace`; removed the stray mount
  artifact before committing.

## Follow-Up Tasks

- None. (Phase 6 — real cron cadences — is next per the roadmap.)

## Commit Readiness

- Requirements implemented: yes (timeline, both entry points + hints, textContent,
  400/404, large-payload cap).
- Read-only / least-privilege rules hold: yes (no new DB surface).
- Time-windowed queries partition-pruned: yes (EXPLAIN-confirmed, both hints).
- Schema assumptions confirmed live: yes (event fields, worst-case size, pruning).
- Review findings addressed or deferred: none outstanding.
- Validation recorded: yes.
- Ready to commit: yes.

# Phase 4 — Incremental Run Cache (in-process)

Date:
2026-06-26

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_4_summary_table.txt`

Git Commit:
8643f3d (impl); review fixes follow in a subsequent commit

## Goals

- Retire the heavy background grid query by parsing each app_run_logs row at most
  once per process lifetime (Option B: in-process incremental cache, no DB writes).
- Show last-run-per-(app,job) so dormant jobs stay visible (stale) instead of
  vanishing under a lookback window.

## Built

- `lib/run-cache.js`: DB-free cache (Map keyed by app+job). merge (idempotent,
  keep max inserted_at per key), evict (retention), sinceBound (watermark-overlap,
  floor-clamped), watermark advance. Unit-testable with injected rows.
- `db/queries.js`: `JOBS_LATEST_SQL` now bounded by `inserted_at >= $1::timestamptz`;
  `jobsLatestSince(sinceIso)` replaces `jobsLatest(lookbackDays)`.
- `server.js`: removed the Phase 2 full-rescan snapshot. One `refreshOnce` driver:
  bootstrap when cache not ready (sinceBound = retention floor), else a tick
  (sinceBound = watermark - overlap). Serves from the cache; 503 until ready.
- `test/run-cache.test.js`: 8 tests (bootstrap, idempotent re-merge, newer/older,
  eviction, watermark monotonicity, empty merge, sinceBound, ready).
- Env: added `SUMMARY_RETENTION_DAYS` (30) + `SUMMARY_OVERLAP_MS` (300000); removed
  `GRID_LOOKBACK_DAYS`. Updated `.env.example` / `markdown/ENVIRONMENT.md`.

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- 30-day bootstrap = 23 jobs in ~15s (raw SQL) / ~31s live incl. connect, behind
  the warming 503; tick window (since watermark-overlap) = 9–43ms, prunes to one
  partition. Both windows' newest inserted_at is identical, so the watermark stays
  correct after every merge.
- `hhm_rpp_siemens` (SIEMENS_CT, SIEMENS_MRI), idle ~16.9 days, is invisible at 7d
  but present and STALE at 30d — the blind spot the lookback created.
- Insert-lag (inserted_at vs run-end dt): p95 ~0.29s, max ~3.6s -> the 5-min
  overlap is ~80x margin. No doc corrections needed; schema matches the contract.

## Important Decisions

### Two review adjustments over the plan

Decision: (1) listen first; one interval drives bootstrap-if-not-ready (retry on
failure) else tick — never block listen on bootstrap. (2) Removed
`GRID_LOOKBACK_DAYS` rather than leaving it inert.
Reason: keep `/healthz` and the 503-warming path live during the ~31s bootstrap,
and make a boot-time DB failure self-heal; avoid a misleading dead env knob.
Tradeoff: a cold start re-bootstraps the retention window (~31s) on every restart
(single instance, behind warming — acceptable).

### Keep the `lookbackDays` response field

Decision: keep the key, populate with the retention value (30).
Reason: eviction means a job shows iff its last run is within retention, so
"last 30d" is accurate; preserves the grid response shape (no UI change).

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: none added — still `ops_dashboard_ro`,
  SELECT only, no write surface (Option A deferred).
- Query / partition-pruning impact: grid query now `inserted_at >= $1`; ticks prune
  to one partition.
- Performance impact: request path 2.7ms (was ~17–28s on the old snapshot's cold
  path); heavy work is one bootstrap + cheap ticks, off the request path.
- API compatibility impact: `/api/jobs/latest` response shape unchanged; `/api/errors`
  and `/api/runs/:run_id` untouched.

## Validation

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:lts node --test   # 19 pass (8 new + 11)
docker compose up -d                                       # recreate (.env changed)
```

- node --test: 19 pass.
- Live smoke: healthz 200 in 33ms during bootstrap (listen-first); grid 503 while
  warming, then 200 in 2.7ms; count 23, lookbackDays 30, asOf set; siemens shows
  STALE at 16.9d; observed `grid bootstrap: 23 rows ... 31137ms` then
  `grid tick: 1 rows -> 23 jobs ... 43ms`.

## Review Notes

Pre-implementation: plan review raised the two adjustments above; both applied.

Post-implementation: external (Codex) review, run from the phase log + commits.
Accepted fixes (subsequent commit):

- (medium) The overlap ticks absorb commit-lag skew but not a true backfill — a
  row committed now with inserted_at older than (watermark - overlap) would be
  missed until restart. Added a periodic full-retention reconciliation
  (`SUMMARY_RECONCILE_MS`, default 6 h): every interval a tick instead does a full
  retention re-scan; merge is idempotent so it never duplicates. Covered by a new
  cache test.
- (low) `KEY_SEP` was a literal NUL byte -> git treated `lib/run-cache.js` as
  binary. Rewrote as the `"\x00"` escape (same NUL at runtime, ASCII source).
- (nit) Recorded this entry's commit SHA instead of "Pending".

No issues found in the bootstrap-retry guard or eviction; 19/19 tests passed at
review time (20/20 after the reconciliation test).

## Commit Readiness

- Read-only / least-privilege rules hold: yes.
- Time-windowed queries partition-pruned: yes.
- Schema assumptions confirmed live: yes.
- Validation recorded: yes.
- Ready to commit: yes.

# Phase 0 — Workflow Scaffold

Date:
2026-06-26

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
`prompts/prompt_0_workflow_scaffold.txt`

Git Commit:
8e4d7fb (scaffold); review fixes follow in a subsequent commit

Review Artifacts:
- Review handoff: `notes/review_handoff_phase_0.md`
- Review results: external (Codex) — 4 findings (2 medium, 1 low, 1 nit), all addressed

## Goals

- Adapt the phase-based, prompt-driven workflow paradigm to ops-dashboard.
- Encode hard-won facts (read-only, json-not-jsonb, partitioning, RO role,
  snapshot perf, Docker-only deploy) into durable docs.
- Seed the roadmap and phase log so future work is repeatable.

## Built

- `markdown/`: FLOW, ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES, PROMPTS, PHASE_TEMPLATE, PHASE_LOG,
  REVIEW_CHECKLIST, ENVIRONMENT, DEPLOYMENT.
- `prompts/`: prompt_0 (this) plus planned prompts 4–7.
- `notes/`: directory for review handoffs and results.

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- None (docs-only phase; no runtime/query changes).

## Architecture Notes

- Read-only / least-privilege impact: none (documentation).
- Deployment impact: none.

## Validation

- Workflow files exist; `git status` reviewed. No app build required.
- Post-review: corrected `db/setup-readonly-role.sql` tested live (idempotent
  re-run succeeds; the previous DO-body form fails with `syntax error at or near ":"`,
  confirming the bug).

## Review Notes

Source: external (Codex) on `notes/review_handoff_phase_0.md`.

Accepted fixes:

- `db/setup-readonly-role.sql`: `:'ro_pw'` was interpolated inside a `DO $$..$$`
  body where psql does not expand it -> invalid PL/pgSQL. Rewrote with `\gexec` +
  `ALTER ROLE` outside any dollar-quoted body. (medium)
- `markdown/DEPLOYMENT.md`: bind-mount dirs now created with
  `sudo install -d -o 105 -g 987 ...` to match the stated ownership. (medium)
- `prompts/prompt_4_summary_table.txt`: made the role split firm (DDL by an
  admin/migration role, reads on `ops_dashboard_ro`, a separate minimal writer) so
  a future phase can't "solve" it by expanding the read role. (low)
- This entry's commit SHA recorded instead of "Pending". (nit)

Deferred findings:

- None. No secret values were found in the docs (the `PGPASSWORD=<...>` text is a
  placeholder).

## Commit Readiness

- Ready to commit: yes (no runtime change).

# Phase 3 — Code-Review Hardening

Date:
2026-06-26

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
— (predates prompt system)

Git Commit:
f53a256

Review Artifacts:

- Review handoff: `docs/code-review-handoff.md`
- Review results: external (Codex) — 5 findings, all addressed

## Built

- Created least-privilege role `ops_dashboard_ro` (CONNECT + USAGE + SELECT only)
  and migrated the deployment off the `postgres` superuser; `db/setup-readonly-role.sql`.
- `/api/runs/:run_id`: uuid validation (400 instead of a cast-error 500) + optional
  `inserted_at` hint that prunes the drill-down to one partition (~8ms).
- Defensive duration parsing in SQL (ISO regex guard so one bad row can't fail the
  whole grid refresh; negative spans clamp to null) mirrored in `lib/runs.js`.
- SSL fail-closed for `PG_SSLMODE=verify-*`; generic 500 messages.
- `node:test` coverage for `lib/runs.js` and `lib/staleness.js` (11 tests).

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- Read via the partitioned parent is covered by a single `SELECT` grant on the
  parent; the RO role cannot write (verified: `permission denied`).
- Hinted drill-down prunes to one monthly partition (verified via `EXPLAIN`).

## Important Decisions

### Migrate to a read-only role immediately

Decision: create `ops_dashboard_ro` and repoint the live deployment now.
Reason: the app was running as superuser — the riskier state to leave up.
Tradeoff: introduced a second credential to manage; old superuser still valid in DB.

## Validation

- `node --test` → 11 pass. Live smoke: healthz ok under RO role; invalid uuid → 400;
  drill-down with hint → 200 in ~8ms.

## Commit Readiness

- Ready to commit: yes.

# Phase 2 — Background-Refreshed Grid Snapshot

Date:
2026-06-26

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
— (predates prompt system)

Git Commit:
4d19352

## Built

- Moved the heavy `/api/jobs/latest` query off the request path: refresh a
  snapshot on a background interval (`GRID_REFRESH_MS`, default 120s) and serve it
  instantly (~4ms). Age/staleness recomputed per-request so they stay live.
- 503 "warming" until the first refresh lands; UI shows snapshot `asOf` time.

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- The grid query detoasts ~150 MB of `verbose_log` JSON over 7 days
  (`data_acquisition` alone ≈ 99 MB / 7.7k rows) → ~17s; far too slow for a request.

## Important Decisions

### Snapshot now, summary table later

Decision: cache a background snapshot rather than build the summary table yet.
Reason: fastest path to a usable dashboard; data only changes every ~15 min.
Tradeoff: stopgap — the heavy query still runs every 2 min. Tracked as Phase 4.

## Commit Readiness

- Ready to commit: yes.

# Phase 1 — v1 Dashboard Slice

Date:
2026-06-25

Status:
Completed

Prompt:
— (predates prompt system)

Git Commit:
f34b90f

## Goals

- Confirm the live `util.app_run_logs` schema, then scaffold a thin vertical slice.

## Built

- `db/pg-pool.js`, `db/queries.js`, `lib/runs.js`, `lib/staleness.js`,
  `config/schedules.js`, `server.js`, `index.js`, `public/index.html`,
  `docker-compose.yaml`, `.env.example`.
- Endpoints: `/api/jobs/latest`, `/api/errors`, `/api/runs/:run_id`, `/healthz`.

## Schema Facts Confirmed (live DB)

- `verbose_log`/`warn_error_logs` are `json` (not jsonb/text).
- `inserted_at timestamptz default now()` exists with a DESC index; table is
  range-partitioned by month (filter `inserted_at` to prune).
- Only 4 apps currently write to the DB.
- Job = `verbose_log->0->'note'->'argv'->>2`; `data_acquisition` has none → `(default)`.

## Important Decisions

### Stack: Node + Express + pg-promise + static vanilla JS

Decision: Option A from `docs/proposed-architecture.md`.
Reason: matches the suite, smallest footprint, fastest to ship.
Tradeoff: manual UI; a richer frontend can come later behind the same API.

## Commit Readiness

- Ready to commit: yes.
